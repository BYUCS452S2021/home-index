# Pitch: Home Index

## Description

There are often times in my life when I can't remember what closet or box I stored my stuff in, or times when I look at a box in my closet and can't remember what is in it. When that happens, I wish I had x-ray vision or the ability to just know without pulling it off the top shelf and searching through it.

That's where Home Index comes into the picture. Home Index is a simple personal inventory app that lets you organize all your belongs by their room, closet and boxes. With just a quick search on your phone, you can quickly locate the exact location of all your belongings. Or, with a simple scan of a QR code you could see the contents of any box in your closet. You never have to search endlessly for that old sweater or your extra phone charger again.

## Team

Because of my experience with full stack development, I am on looking to work with one other person. I have a colleague that wants to work on the project with me and that would allow for easier coordination of time because we work on similar schedules and see each other everyday in the office.

## Implementation

Planning to use Spring's JDBC connections to connect to a PostgreSQL database. This database will be accessible through a Spring Boot or Jersey (JAX-RS) REST API. If usage increase greatly, NoSQL will be implemented to allow for extremely large number of concurrent users.

## SQL

Most likely Postgres as stated above, maybe MySQL if teammates are more familiar with its syntax.

## NoSQL

Most likely to implement a document based database as that best represents the relationships of our data models.

## Business

At startup, this app will be free of charge with available premium features. Base features will be limited on number of rooms/closets available per user. Upgrading to premium would allow unlimited number of rooms, multiple properties and the ability to upload pictures of the items.

Additionally, customers would have the option of ordering QR code labels that can be stuck to the outside of boxes so they can be scanned to show the container contents. Eventually Home Index branded storage containers could be manufactured, maybe even "Smart Containers" that prompt the owner to update the contents anytime it has been opened and closed.

## Operation

At start, this can be run by the two engineers of the project, but as the business grows, additional positions will need to be created and filled for other non-engineering roles. (e.g. Marketing, Sales, HR, and Financial Advisors)

## Legal

The business would be a Utah LLC.

## Technical

Current priorities:

1. Get a working MVP to present to potential investors.
2. Create a stable and working beta and offer to testers.
3. Adjust changes per tester suggestions.
4. Begin advertising.
5. Release first major release.
6. Continue support and upgrades.

## Social

Initial advertising will be done through different social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.
